# 🚀 Python 30 Days Challenge

A **30-day hands-on challenge** to become proficient in Python by building **real-world scripts, automation tools, CLI utilities, and desktop software** — one project every day.

This repository focuses on **learning by building**, not watching tutorials.

---

## 🎯 Objective

By the end of this challenge, I aim to confidently build:

* 🖥️ PC mini software
* 🐧 Linux utilities
* 🤖 Automation tools
* 🧰 CLI applications
* 🪟 GUI-based desktop apps

Each day introduces **increasing complexity**, pushing toward real software engineering skills.

---

## 🧠 Challenge Rules

* ✅ One working Python script/app every day
* ❌ No skipping days
* 🧱 Difficulty increases gradually
* 🧪 Every project must be executable
* 📖 Learn → Build → Improve
